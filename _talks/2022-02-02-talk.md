“The Differential Mode of Chinese Ancient Society” is from the work of Fei Xiaotong.

The concept appears in his influential book:

From the Soil (Xiangtu Zhongguo, 乡土中国), first published in 1947.

In this book, Fei introduces the idea of the “differential mode of association” (差序格局), describing the structure of traditional Chinese social relations as concentric circles centered on the self, rather than being organized by formal group boundaries as in Western societies.
